HOUSEHOLDS, CRAFTS, AND FEASTING IN THE ANCIENT ANDES: 
THE VILLAGE CONTEXT OF EARLY NASCA CRAFT CONSUMPTION 

Kevin J. Vaughn 
Craft consumption in Early Nasca (ca. A.D. 1-450) society is explored by evaluating the use of polychrome pottery within the context of a residential village. Data are presented from the Early Nasca village, Marcaya, where excavations utilizing a household archaeology approach revealed that most polychromes were consumed by households with high and low sta­tus alike, while certain vessel shapes were reserved for high-status households. These findings challenge the common assump­tion that highly valued crafts were monopolized by elites in middle-range societies, and show instead that there is a potential demand for crafts by both elites and commoners. It is argued that polychrome pottery was broadly used in Nasca because it was integral to ritual consumption that first took place in feasting ceremonies at the regional center Cahuachi, while cer­tain vessel types were restricted to high-status households that acted as intermediaries between Cahuachi and the village. 
Recientemente, las arque6logos han dirigido su atenci6n mas al uso de las productos artesanales en las sociedades de caci­cazgos. Los estudios han demostrado que el uso de estos productos en las culturas prehispanicasfue mucho mas complicado de lo que se habia previamente sugerido. No obstante, las analisis han tendido afavorecer estudios con un enfoque al con­sumo de las elites. Este art[culo explora c6mo las productos artesenales fueron utilizados par las elites y las plebeyos. El enfoque es la sociedad Nasca Temprano ( 1-450 d.C.) donde se evalua el consumo de la ceramica policroma dentro de! con­texto de Marcaya, una aldeil residencial. Las investigaciones que utilizan la perspectiva de la arqueologia domestica reve­laron que una ceramica policroma fue utilizada par individuos de estatus alto y bajo. Par otro lado, ciertos tipos de vasijas fueron reservados para las elites. Se sugiere que debido a su uso ritual, la ceramica polfcroma disfrut6 de una distribuci6n extensa en la sociedad Nasca Temprana, tanto en las aldeas coma en las centros ceremoniales coma Cahuachi, donde Jue usada en las ceremonias. Los resultados del estudio tienen implicaciones para nuestra comprensi6n del modo de incorpo­raci6n de los productos artesanales en las econom[as de las sociedades de cacicazgos. 


he nature of crafts, and the ways in which Tfinely made material objects are integrated into the economies of middle-range soci­eties, has been the subject of a growing number of archaeological investigations (Ames 1995; Bay­man 1999; Costin 2001; Costin and Wright 1998; Mills 2000; Shimada 1998; Spielmann 2002). Tra­ditionally, studies that evaluate crafts have followed a basic dichotomy between highly valued prestige goods monopolized by elites and ordinary utilitar­

-,ian goods that enjoyed unrestricted distribution (e.g., Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Frankenstein and Rowlands I 978). It is often argued that crafted pres­tige goods were valuable for the social reproduc­tion of elites, while non-elites did not have the means or the reasons to finance the production of these goods. Recently, however, there has been a general dissatisfaction with these dichotomous models to explain the social and economic uses of crafts in middle-range societies (Bayman 2002; Costin 2001; Costin and Wright 1998; Inomata 2001; Spielmann 2002; Trubitt 2000). In particu­lar, it is now recognized that there was a potential demand for crafts from all sectors of society, and that crafts moved through various segments of soci­ety in complex economic patterns not easily explainable by traditional models. 
For example, in a critique of the prestige-goods model, which assumes that social valuables were monopolized by elites in an effort to gain political power (e.g., Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Friedman and Rowlands 1978), Bayman (2002) has argued that Hohokam marine shell ornaments were not simply prestige goods produced for and used exclu-

sively by elites. Instead, these artifacts had differ­ent roles in Hohokam society as symbols of group identity, insignia of office, as well as instruments of power, and were used by a variety of social groups that included elites and commoners (Bay­man 2002:70). Importantly, this study implies that simple models such as the prestige-goods model fail to take into account the different roles and meanings of crafts in middle-range societies (Bay­man 2002:74). 
Recent evidence suggests that finely painted polychrome pottery of the Early Intermediate period Nasca culture also does not fit easily into a dichotomy of prestige versus utilitarian good. This dichotomy fails to adequately describe and explain the production, circulation, and consumption of these items. Though polychromes were finely made (Carmichael 1990), are well-known as the princi­pal vehicle of Nasca ideology (Carmichael 1998), and were employed by foreign elites outside of the immediate Nasca region as status-enhancing pres­tige goods (Carmichael 1992a; Goldstein 2000; Sil­verman 1997; Valdez 1998), within the Nasca heartland polychromes appear to have been con­sumed by varied segments of society, not just elites (Carmichael 1988, 1995, 1998). Furthermore, while production of these items was restricted and indica­tive of specialization (Vaughn and Neff 2000), their consumption, paradoxically, was not restricted. 
I evaluate the contradiction between the restricted production yet widespread distribution of Nasca polychromes. I situate the discussion by con­sidering the consumption of highly valued crafts in middle-range societies, highlighting recent research that suggests there was a demand for crafts in mid­dle-range societies from both elites and non-elites. I argue that one way for non-elites to obtain crafts was through the commensal politics of ceremonial feasting. I present primary data from the Early Nasca domestic site, Marcaya, where excavations under­taken from the perspective of household archaeol­ogy revealed that a large quantity of poly chromes, particularly bowls and vases, was consumed by households of both high and low status even though these items were produced elsewhere. I argue that polychrome bowls and vases were consumed widely in Nasca society because they were integral to rit­ual consumption first carried out in feasting cere­monies at Cahuachi, the region's ceremonial center. Certain vessel types, modeled headjars in particu­lar, however, were restricted to high-status house­holds at Marcaya. I suggest that their restricted con­sumption is related to prestige-building activities by high-status individuals and households who may have been intermediaries between regional cere­monial centers and villages. 
Crafts, Consumption, and Feasting in 
Middle-Range Societies 

While a definition of "craft" potentially includes any material object made by humans (Costin 1998), a more narrow definition is employed here. A craft is defined as any object or group of objects manu­factured by skills that not all members of society have. In other words, crafts are objects produced in the context of specialization, no matter the scale, intensity, or context of that specialization (e.g., Costin 1991). 
Research in the last two decades has suggested that the specialized production of crafts was inte­gral to many nonstratified, middle-range, and even small-scale societies. Furthermore, crafts were pro­duced, circulated, and consumed in very complex economic systems within these smaller-scale soci­eties (Arnold and Munns 1994; Bayman 1999; Clark 1995; Clark and Parry 1990; Cross 1993; Sassaman 1998; Spielmann 2002). 
Crafts and Consumption 
Studies of craft specialization have tended to favor the analysis of craft production over other stages of what can be referred to as the "craft economy" (Bay­man 1999). Craft consumption in particular has seen little explicit treatment when compared to produc­tion, even though much of what archaeologists study is directly related to consumption in one form or another (Smith 1998). I follow Smith's ( 1998: 115) general definition of consumption by defining craft consumption as the selection, use, maintenance, repair, and discard of an item after it has been pro­duced and circulated. Craft consumption is an important avenue of inquiry because without under­standing what segments of society consumed them and in what contexts, it is difficult to postulate exactly why crafts were produced in the first place. This is especially the case because production is generally organized to meet consumer demands (Costin 2001 :306; Morrison 1994; Smith 1998), no matter who those consumers might have been.

Not surprisingly, when consumption has been considered in the analysis of archaeological data, discussion is dominated by the elite consumption of crafts, as these individuals are often assumed to be the most important consumers of these goods. While crafted goods were vital to elites in the polit­ical economy of preindustrial societies primarily as a form of wealth finance (e.g., Earle 1997), stud­ies have rarely emphasized the consumption of crafts by non-elites even though recent research suggests that they were important to this segment of society as well (Bayman 2002; Wattenmaker 1998). One reason is that, whether implicit or explicit, a distinction is usually made between crafts producedfor people in positions of social and polit­ical power or prominence, and crafts manufactured for the "mundane spheres of life" (Helms 1993: 14 ). Helms (1993, 1999) makes the distinction unam­biguously as she reserves the term "skilled craft­ing" of goods for "elite related 'states or forms of meaning'" (Helms 1993: 14). Furthermore, the products of skilled crafting are reserved for public, political spheres while "ordinary" goods are made for the private domestic sphere (Helms 1993: 14). 
There are theoretical reasons to assume that the products of skilled crafting, implying a certain level of competence, were reserved for those in a posi­tion of power. The primary reason, of course, is that elites are the only members of society with the resources to finance these endeavors (Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Earle 1991, 1997). Highly valued crafted goods are well known as symbols of power and insignia of office for elites in non-state soci­eties (e.g., Helms 1999). However, have archaeol­ogists dismissed the possibility that other members of society could access these goods? Need we assume that under all circumstances the products of skilled crafting were reserved only for those in positions of power? 
For example, Lecount (1999) demonstrates that 
commoners of the Terminal Classic at Xunantunich 
also consumed highly valued goods that were dis­
tributed to them by elites (LeCount 1999:254). 
LeCount describes a shift in the distribution of 
polychrome pottery at two sites in Belize between 
the Late Classic II phase and the Terminal Classic. 
While previously limited to elite contexts during 
the Late Classic II, polychrome pottery enjoyed 
unrestricted distribution during the Terminal Clas­
sic (Lecount 1999:251 ). LeCount argues that poly­
chrome pottery was distributed equally across social groups during the Terminal Classic because elites at the time emphasized community solidar­ity while building vertical alliances and symboliz­ing shared power by gifting these crafted items to commoners (LeCount 1999:254), resulting in the relatively widespread distribution of polychrome pottery. 
The importance of this case study is its demon­stration of how a crafted item (polychrome pottery) moves through various social strata by means of the political strategies employed by elites. Thus, tracing the distribution and consumption of this particular artifact class revealed important insights into Terminal Classic political strategies. 
Other studies have suggested a potential demand for crafts by both elites and non-elites. For exam­ple, Wattenmaker ( 1998) has proposed that crafts embody culturally meaningful symbolic commu­nication and that information is embedded in some crafts that appeal to all members of a social group, not just elites. Indeed, crafts, especially highly vis­ible ones such as serving vessels, cloth, and per­sonal adornments, provide material evidence of group membership (Bayman 2002:80; Costin 1998:3; Wobst 1977), symbolize the identity of their producers and consumers (Chilton 1999), and continuously reinforce this intragroup identity (Hodder 1982). These factors contribute to a demand for crafts by people from all segments of society. 
Crafts and the Politics of Feasting 
While there may be a demand for crafts by all seg­ments of society, obtaining them is problematic for individuals and groups who lack the means and the resources to do so. The example from the Termi­nal Classic illustrates that elites can use highly val­ued crafts as political currency by giving them to commoners in an effort to build community soli­darity. One social arena in which non-elites can obtain goods in this fashion is through the com­mensal politics of feasting ceremonies (e.g., Dietler 1990, 1996; Dietler and Hayden 2001a), "events .. . constituted by the communal consumption of food and/or drink" (Dietler and Hayden 2001 b:3). Feasts are "inherently political" (Dietler 2001 :66), and feasting as a social and communal act provides the opportunity for political action, status negotiation, and social change (Dietler 1990, 2001; Hayden

1996, 2001; Junker 2001; Lau 2002; LeCount 2001; Potter 2000). 
As instruments of change, feasts provide oppor­tunities for sponsors to enhance their status, often accomplished through the display of goods includ­ing important artifacts (DeMarrais et al. l996; Wiessner 2001: 116) and through gift giving (Clark and Blake 1994:21; Dietler 1996:91; LeCount 1999; Perodie 2001 ). By their very nature feasts cre­ate reciprocal obligations between host and guest (Lau 2002:280) through the gifting of food and drink as well as items of material import. 
A well-known ethnographic example of the rela­tionship between gifting and status enhancement is the Northwest Coast potlatch characterized by the 
distribution of large quantities of food and goods 
(Piddocke 1965). Potlatches were highly political venues of status display where social prestige was obtained and enhanced (see Boas 1966). Piddocke (1965) suggests that potlatches provided opportu­nities for sponsors to display their generosity by dis­tributing food and wealth, thereby enhancing their social prestige. The potlatch, then, provides one ethnographic example where the mechanism of communal feasting afforded the opportunity for par­ticipants, including non-elites, to obtain highly val­ued crafts in the form of gifts given by feast sponsors. 
Feasting in the Andes. Ethnographic, ethnohis­toric, and archaeological studies have demonstrated that feasting was prevalent throughout the prehis­panic Andes. Andean "work party feasts" featur­ing the distribution of abundant quantities of chicha maize beer were given for workers in exchange for their participation in labor projects (Lau 2002). Such feasts are well known among modem indige­nous groups (Allen 1988), the Inka Empire (Bray 2003; Morris 1979; Murra 1980), and pre-Inka Andean societies as well (Gero 1992; Hastorf and Johannessen 1993; Lau 2002; Moore 1989; Mose­ley 1975). 
A clear example of feasting in a middle-range Andean society is documented among the Early Intermediate period Recuay. Lau (2002) argues that by A.D. 500, evidence for public ceremonies iml0l1t·ing bath ancestor worship and public feast­ing was apparent at Chinchawas, a high-altitude Recuay site in the Cordillera Negra near Huaraz. During the earlier Kayan and Chinchawasi phases 
(A.D.500-800), the occupation was characterized by public feasting clearly associated with high-sta­tus residences. These feasts were arenas whereby local elites made efforts to enhance their status through wealth display of sumptuary goods and the consumption of large quantities of chicha and 
camelid meat (Lau 2002:298). In contrast, the later 
Warmi phase (after A.D. 800) was characterized by smaller-scale ceremonies consisting of dedicatory offerings and ritual drinking. This local shift is explained as the result of Wari expansion into the region (Lau 2002:300). 
This example illustrates the importance of feast­ing in the early development of Andean middle­range societies. Feasting was a critical social setting in which local elites were able to garner prestige and co-opt the labor of non-elites by appearing to be generous in their distribution of large amounts of food and drink. Lau sees this pattern as part of broader "leadership innovations ... and ... strate­gies" during the Early Intennediate period through­out the Andes (Lau 2002:300). 
Craft Consumption and Feasting in Early Nasca 
Based on the foregoing summary of recent theo­retical developments regarding crafts, I suggest that it is equally valuable to look at non-elite con­sumption. While demand from elites and non-elites may exist, the potential for non-elites to obtain finely crafted goods in middle-range societies can be problematic. One way non-elites can obtain them is through feasting ceremonies, a social arena in which elites display and distribute highly valued crafts (such as polychrome pottery) to simultane­ously enhance their own status while engendering group solidarity. In the Andes, feasting was an activ­ity that elites could use to create reciprocal oblig­ations and social debt very early in prehistory. 
It is in this theoretical context that I examine the apparent paradox that exists between the produc­tion and consumption of Early Nasca polychrome pottery, which according to recent research was produced in restricted contexts yet distributed widely to all segments of society. I focus on Early Nasca craft consumption by determining the degree to which polychromes were consumed by non­elites. Ifconsumed as previously assumed, can we account for this non-elite consumption in the broader theoretical context of crafts, feasting, and middle-range societies outlined above? 
To evaluate non-elite craft consumption, atten-

tion should first tum to residential villages where the majority of non-elites lived in prehispanic Andean societies. I therefore shift to a discussion of the village approach, and to evaluate degrees of status differentiation within the Andean village, I focus on households. 
Elites, Non-Elites, and Households in Andean Villages 
Until recently, the study of prehispanic Andean societies has been characterized by an emphasis on urban sites and ceremonial centers-what could be referred to as the "temples-and-tombs" approach (Schreiber 1999: 162). Indeed, as Schreiber indi­cates, the emphasis on larger, more spectacular archaeological sites has come at the expense of understanding smaller, humbler settlements, which make up the largest portion of Andean societies. In order to evaluate this segment of society, archae­ologists, like all social scientists, must employ a variety of interpretive scales to build satisfactory models (Smith 1993 ). One approach, referred to as the "village" approach (Vaughn 2000), also the "local perspective" (Bermann 1994 ), the "com­munity" perspective (Kolb and Snead 1997), and 
"rural archaeology" (Schwartz and Falconer 1994 ), focuses on single communities. While the village approach does not ignore patterns of change at a regional level, it assumes that analyzing smaller set­tlements is a profitable means of evaluating pre­historic societies. Because a village or community has its own sociopolitical order, economic patterns, and historical trajectories, often very different from that witnessed at other scales, the village approach necessarily complements regional analyses and provides relatively fine-grained perspectives on social and economic organization that regional approaches cannot provide. Furthermore, the means by which the village articulates with other segments of society (such as the civic-ceremonial center, regional center, etc.) is key to understand­ing that society. More importantly, if we are to understand the movement of goods from produc­tion to consumption in prehispanic societies, we must focus on where those goods were actually consumed. 
Regardless of the name of the approach, an archaeological research program that focuses on a smaller level of analysis than the region-one that evaluates a single village-must have a primary unit of analysis. Although some of the above approaches employ the entire community as the unit of analysis (e.g., Kolb and Snead 1997), house­holds are more frequently targeted. 
Ethnographic and ethnohistoric evidence sug­gests that the nuclear family household was an important economic unit in prehispanic Andean societies (Aldenderfer and Stanish 1993; Stanish 1989: 8, 1992: 18). Households are the primary pro­ductive, consumptive, and exchange units in ethno­graphic examples of Andean societies. As the principal economic unit, the household is the most useful analytical tool for evaluating sociopolitical and economic relationships within archaeological settlements (Stanish 1989:7). 
One primary advantage of "household archae­ology" is that status differences within a village can be evaluated (Bermann 1997; Blanton 1995; Hirth 1993; Santley and Hirth 1993; Stanish 1989, 1992; van Gijseghem 2001 ). Following this approach, we would expect status differences within a commu­nity to be manifested in one or more of the fol­lowing ways: ( 1) There may be households that are larger than others. Ethnographically and ethnohis­torically, individuals of higher rank tend to have larger households than those of lower rank (Cou­pland and Banning 1996; Hirth 1993:123; Netting 1982), resulting in much larger physical structures. 
(2) There may be structures that contain a variety of specialized architectural features, are subdivided into public and private space, or involve a greater labor investment in construction (Abrams 1989; Hirth 1993: 124 ). (3) There may be structures whose artifact assemblage contains goods of higher value, and more items overall because higher-status households can potentially consume relatively more while producing less (Hirth 1993; Smith 1987; Wilk and Ashmore 1988:124). Valuable goods can be in the form of "exotics," products requiring higher labor investments, or items with significant ritual or cultural value that may not nec­essarily be related to distant sources or high labor investment. These three expectations serve as indi­cators of either individuals, families, or households of higher status (Hirth 1993:123). 
Household Craft Consumption in Nasca

period Nasca society. The Nasca culture developed a craft economy of finely made polychrome ceram­ics early in its history, and preliminary observations indicate that these ceramics, although made in restricted contexts, were distributed widely and consumed by many social groups. Therefore, Nasca provides the opportunity to evaluate archaeologi­cal assumptions about the role crafts played in mid­dle-range societies. While Nasca appears to have lacked institutionalized inequalities in the form of stratification, forms of rank were clearly present (Carmichael 1988, 1995). These inequalities were manifested in differential burials, suggesting that certain members of Nasca society were ranked above others; however, the degree of differentia­tion, which Carmichael refers to as a "status con­tinuum" ( 1995: 17 5), has not been evaluated in local communities. 
Archaeological Context 
The prehispanic Nasca culture (ca. A. D. 1-750) developed in an area of the south coast of Peru defined by the lea and Grande drainages and their tributaries (Figure 1). The Nasca region, as it is commonly referred to (Carmichael 1998), is extremely dry and is delineated by the Andean foothills to the east, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the lea River valley in the north, and the Las Tran­cas River valley in the south. Discussion focuses on the Southern Nasca Region (hereafter SNR) defined by the Aja, Tierras Blancas (which together converge in the modem town of Nasca to form the Nasca River), Taruga, and Las Trancas river val­leys (Schreiber and Lancho 1995; Vaughn 2000). Ecologically, the region is defined as pre-montane desert formation (ONERN 1971). The rivers that run through the valleys, only intermittently filled with water, are classified as "influent streams" (ONERN 1971; Schreiber and Lancho 1995). 

Despite the somewhat marginal nature of the influent streams and the desert environment, in the early part of Nasca's development, the flooded rivers appear to have provided enough water to nourish crops on an annual basis (Rowe 1963). Indeed, an alliance of chiefdoms based on a mixed agro-pastoral economy flourished in the region dur­ing most of the Early Intermediate period (ca. A. D.

is divided into Early Nasca (phases 2-4), 1 Middle 
Nasca (phase 5), and Late Nasca (phases 6 and 7) 
cultures (Carmichael 1998; Schreiber and Lancho 
1995; also see Silverman and Proulx 2002). 
Recent research has demonstrated that Nasca 
was a loosely allied "confederacy" (Silverman 
1993; Silverman and Proulx 2002) of chiefdoms 
with a mixed agropastoral economic base (Vaughn 
2000). Sociopolitical leadership did not appear to 
be highly centralized in Early Nasca society 
(though see Reindel and Isla 1998, 20012). Instead, 
status was probably negotiated, highly flexible, and 
involved political acts and status display at regional 
ceremonial centers such as Cahuachi, certainly the 
most important of these centers (see below; Sil­
verman and Proulx 2002:244). 
Pottery, Fertility, and Early Nasca Feasting 
Polychrome Pottery. One of the most impressive artifact classes of Nasca, indeed one that has given the prehispanic culture worldwide fame, is its poly­chrome pottery. Since their "discovery" early in the twentieth century, Nasca polychromes were rec­ognized for their quality (Uhle 1914 ). They have very thin vessel walls (Carmichael 1990:34; Proulx . 1968), up to 15 distinct mineral-based slip colors : (Proulx 1968:25), a wide range of vessel shapes, and compelling iconography featuring natural and supernatural motifs. The manufacture and painting of poly chromes took a great deal of technical skill (Carmichael 1990, 1998:224), and it is reasonable to assume that they represent specialized craft pro­duction. The intensity, context, concentration, and scale of that specialization (e.g., Costin 1991; Costin and Hagstrum 1995) have yet to be fully defined. However, the degree of skill required in their manufacture suggests they were not made by 
everyone in society (Vaughn and Neff 2000). Indeed, an instrumental neutron activation analy­sis of a sample of polychromes from Marcaya, an Early Nasca village (see below), has indicated pro­ductive specialization, given the pottery's compo­sitional uniformity when compared to plain utilitarian wares (Vaughn and Neff 2000). 
Agricultural Fertility. Nasca iconography is well known (Carmichael 1992b, 1994; Kroeber 1956; Kroeber and Collier 1998; Proulx 1968, 1983, 1994, 2000; Roark 1965; Sawyer 1961, 1966; Townsend 1985; Uhle 1914), and is generally con­sidered to be Nasca's "principal purveyor of ide­ology" (Carmichael 1998:224). Agricultural fertility is the prevailing theme conveyed on Nasca pottery (Carmichael 1992b, 1994; see also Proulx 2000; Silverman and Proulx 2002), and for Carmichael (1998:224), "the entire corpus of Nasca iconography is a sacred, interrelated visual system with its referents tied to the dominating themes of water and propagation." Given the marginal envi­ronment of the Nasca region, this preoccupation with water and agricultural fertility is not surpris­ing. In fact, the body of iconography depicted on polychromes was only one of several cultural fea­tures left by the people of Nasca that speak to their concern with growth, fertility, and water . 
For example, the famous Nasca geoglyphs (Nasca Lines) have been argued to be an integral part of the worship of mountain gods who con­trolled meteorological phenomena such as clouds, lightning, and most importantly, rain in traditional Andean belief systems (Reinhard 1988:365). The geoglyphs themselves were mostly related to reli­gious practices designed to ensure that water would be provided for people and their crops (Reinhard 1988).

fertility (Carmichael 1992b; DeLeonardis 2000). For example, the "Sprouting Head" motif found on Nasca polychromes, in which plants grow directly out of trophy heads, is seen to represent a direct link between disembodied heads and agricultural fertility (Carmichael 1992b). Additionally, disem­bodied heads are seen as part of the "life to death continuum" (Carmichael 1992b) in which the blood from decapitated heads was necessary for human and plant fecundity (Allen 1981). 
Early Nasca Feasting. Iconographic evidence also suggests that large, group-oriented ceremonies involving feasting were integral to Nasca life. For example, Carmichael (1998:224, Figure 13) observes that a scene depicted on a double-spout bottle provides iconographic evidence for pottery used in ceremonial and feasting contexts. The scene depicts a "central deity" holding a panpipe, sur­rounded by ceramic vessels, and people playing panpipes and trumpets. Carmichael suggests that this bottle may depict a "festival in its early stages" (Carmichael 1998:224). Likewise, Townsend (1985: 125, Figure 7) has reported a flaring bow 1 depicting what he interprets to be an agricultural ceremony. In Townsend's interpretation, the artist "intended to represent a costumed figure such as those who appeared in the public plazas, and per­haps also in agricultural fields, to celebrate the great annual feasts of the Nazca region" (Townsend 1985:125). It is very likely that many of these "great annual feasts" were carried out at Cahuachi, the principal ceremonial center of Early Nasca culture. 
During Early Nasca times, Cahuachi was the focus of pilgrimages and ceremony (Silverman 1993, 2002; Silverman and Proulx 2002). Excava­tions conducted at the site (Silverman 1993) have demonstrated that Cahuachi was not an urban cen­ter in the traditional archaeological sense of the word (based on Old World models of urbaniza­tion), but rather an Andean ceremonial center (e.g., Rowe 1963). The evidence for the ceremonial nature of Cahuachi includes its numerous temple mounds and other structures (Silverman 1993:310), the ceremonial contexts found in excavations and surface analysis (Silverman 1993; Valdez 1994), and the sacred burial grounds located at the site (Sil­verman 1993; see also Silverman and Proulx 2002). By virtue of its ceremonial nature, Cahuachi is believed to be a place where pilgrims from through­out the south coast occasionally congregated to participate in rites of intensification. Many of the group ceremonies conducted at the site involved feasting (see Silverman 1993; Silverman and Proulx 2002:132; Strong 1957:31; Valdez 1994). These ceremonial feasts at Cahuachi were "not just religious acts. They were political acts clothed in ritual and embodying Nasca ideology" (Silverman and Proulx 2002:244 ). Integral to the feasting con­text were the vessels in which food and drink was served. Clearly, the most commonly used vessels were the well-known polychromes, as few other vessels appropriate for serving have been found in excavations at Cahuachi (Silverman 1993). 
Cahuachi was not just an important pilgrimage center and a site of ritual feasting, but was also the location of polychrome production. Previously, it was proposed that an excess of polychrome pot­tery was produced at Cahuachi and distributed to groups making pilgrimages to the site (Vaughn and Neff 2000). Given the current evidence of artifacts related to pottery production (see Vaughn and Neff 2000:88 for a summary), and a compositional study suggesting a restricted locus of polychrome pro­duction, it is clear that some pottery was produced at the ceremonial center (see Silverman 1993:277, Figure 19.9), though it is still unclear how much. 
The Domestic Context of Nasca Polychrome Consumption 
Paradoxically, although Nasca polychromes are very finely made and have restricted production contexts, they were apparently used by all mem­bers of Nasca society. For example, Carmichael has suggested that "(t)he (Nasca) ceramic complex was an open shared system to which all members of society had access" (Carmichael 1995:171). Carmichael's conclusion was based on observa­tions that fine specimens analyzed from burials show evidence of use-wear prior to being interred in tombs, and that most vessel types were available to people regardless of their status. Additionally, researchers working on the south coast of Peru have noted that Nasca habitation sites are covered with the fragmented remains of polychrome pottery (Carmichael 1998:222; Silverman and Proulx 2002), implying that the ceramics were used in domestic as well as ceremonial contexts, and per­haps even moved between these contexts. 
The apparent extensive distribution of poly­chromes throughout the south coast of Peru led 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:54:17, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.2307/4141564 
some early researchers to suggest that Nasca was 
an expansive state extending from the Pisco to the 
Acari valleys and centered at Cahuachi (Rowe 
1963:304; Strong 1957). Recent research indicates 
instead that outside of the lea and Grande drainages, 
polychromes are present to a limited extent in elite 
contexts, and suggests status-building efforts by 
local elites who associated themselves with distant 
powers (Carmichael 1992a; Goldstein 2000; Sil­
verman 1997; Valdez 1998), and specifically with 
those powers associated with Cahuachi (see Valdez 
1998). 
These statements have remained untested 
because securely excavated domestic contexts have 
been lacking within the Nasca heartland. Many 
studies have analyzed ceramics recovered from 
graves (Kroeber 1956; Kroeber and Collier 1998; 
Proulx 1968; Tello 1917; Uhle 1914); however, 
there are few examples of excavated polychrome 
pottery outside of cemetery contexts. These come 
from excavations at Cahuachi, Pueblo Viejo (Isla 
et al. 1984), and recently, Los Molinas and La 
Muna, two large ceremonial sites investigated by 
Reindel and Isla (1998, 2001). Therefore, patterns 
of Nasca pottery use in the domestic context are 
unknown. In an early study of Nasca iconography, 
Catherine Allen suggested that, "We may guess­
from their fineness, apparently impractical vessel 
shapes, and good preservation-that Nasca ceram­
ics were reserved for ritual uses, but beyond this 
speculation the living context of their use is forever 
lost to us" (1981:45-46). 
How, then, are we to understand the apparent wide distribution and consumption of Nasca poly­chromes? How were they incorporated into the "liv­ing context?" That is, how were they used and in what contexts? What relation did the consumption of polychromes at habitations have to the con­
-.sumption of polychromes in ceremonial contexts 
. such as those at Cahuachi? One method for address­ing these questions was to tum attention to a pre­hispanic Nasca village. Given statements by previous researchers, we would expect a high con­sumption of poly chromes among all social groups in the domestic context. Given the nature of status differences at residential sites, however (Goldstein 2000:336), we might also expect a difference in the quantities of polychromes consumed and the kinds of polychromes consumed between high-status and low status groups. To address these questions, as part of a larger research program investigating the domestic context of Early Nasca society, excava­tions were conducted at the small village site, Mar­caya. 
Marca ya 
Marcaya is approximately 1 ha in size and is located in the Yunga ecological zone of the Andean foothills. Lying 16 km upstream from the modem town of Nasca, at an elevation of 1,000 m above sea level, the site is situated on the northern hill­side of the Tierras Blancas River valley on a gen­tly sloping colluvial fan just southeast of Cerro Pongo Chico (Figure 2). 
Surface Analysis 
Because of a lack of deposition, structure founda­tions remain visible on the surface of the site today and bear a strong resemblance to previously recorded early Nasca architecture (Schreiber 1988; Schreiber and Isla 1996). The site consists of over 70 structures concentrated in three separate loci (Figure 3). Two basic types of structures were recorded: houses and patios. Houses are small and round, generally between 3 and 5 m in diameter, with walls composed of unworked and dressed fieldstone set in mud mortar. The walls were orig­inally between 1 and 1.5 m in height. Doors in the house walls led to attached patios, larger ovoid structures up to 14 m in length. Houses and patios formed contiguous structure clusters referred to as patio groups. A number of undefined structures were also recorded. These structures were isolated and had little evidence for domestic occupation. They may be ancient corrals, though this remains to be determined through further testing. 
Twenty-three patio groups were recorded through surface analysis and mapping. On the sur­face, the recorded patio groups appeared to be archaeological households using the three criteria outlined by Stanish for recognizing households in the archaeological record (Stanish 1989, 1992). That is, they were ( 1) distinct structure groups that were (2) repeated throughout the site, and (3) con­tained the material remains of domestic activities. The goal of the excavations was to obtain infor­mation on socioeconomic activities that took place in the patio groups, including the nature of poly­chrome consumption, and status differences at the

site, including differences in polychrome con­sumption between identified patio groups. 
A surface analysis was undertaken to determine the variability in household size and labor invest­ment present at Marcaya. In the surface inspection, the size of patio groups, the presence of internal architectural features, and the quality of architec­ture were recorded. Based on overall dimensions, patio groups were defined as either small or large, with patio groups over 90 m2 defined as large. Inter­nal features and architectural spaces visible on the surface were also recorded. Internally defined spaces within houses and patios were very rare and found in only three patio groups. Finally, the vari­ability in architectural quality was recorded. While in most houses, walls were constructed using sim­ple fieldstone and mud mortar, in some houses, an effort was made to delineate well-defined interior spaces by using partially dressed field stone with smooth, flat sides. Architectural differences were also manifested in the construction of house doors. Doors were made by either leaving a gap in the wall construction or were framed by two dressed stones placed vertically on either side of the gap. 
In short, with regards to surface evidence of sta­tus differences there were four criteria that differ­entiated households: ( 1) size of the patio group, (2) presence of internal architectural features, (3) pres­ence of worked stone in wall architecture, and (4) presence of worked stone in the doors of houses. Only three patio groups at Marca ya met all four of these criteria: X, XII, and XV and, based on these surface differences, they were defined as high-sta­tus households (Table 2; see Figure 4). 
Household Excavations at Marcaya 
A judgmental sampling strategy was chosen to attain excavation data that would permit evaluation of the differences between high-and low-status households. Excavations were conducted within eight different patio groups (as well as ten isolated structures), of which two were high status and six were low status (Figure 4). 
The most common features encountered in exca­vations were those related to food processing, preparation, and storage (Figures 5 and 6). Each of the patio groups excavated contained artifacts and features related to these activities, though the iden­tified features and quantity of material recovered varied from one patio group to another. Hearths were found in numerous structures including both houses and patios, and large batanes (grinding stones) and chungas (rockers) were recovered as well. Excavation and surface analysis (as many were exposed on the surface) revealed stone-lined pits in virtually every structure (Figure 7). Local

informants indicated that modem features similar to these were referred to in recent times as collo­mas, and this term was adopted for the prehispanic features.3 
Aside from the processing and storage of sub­sistence-related goods, material correlates of other domestic activities were found. Most patio groups produced some evidence for lithic production using local raw materials and obsidian from the Quispi­sisa source (Vaughn and Glascock 2004 ). One patio group (V) appears to be a small lithic workshop. Additionally, residents of each household were involved in weaving. Whole and fragmented spin-die whorls were recovered in most patio groups. Analysis of the size and weight of the spindle whorls suggests they were used to spin camelid wool (Vaughn 2000). 
Economic activities at Marcaya appear to have been predominantly organized by the household. Archaeological correlates for economic activities found in each patio group suggest that households were the primary economic unit at Marcaya and each was economically independent, as each patio group was functionally redundant and had the com­ponents to sustain a domestic unit. All households contained evidence for food storage and process-

ing, cooking, and consumption. Collomas, the only known storage facilities at Marcaya, were found without exception, either within the confines of patios and houses or in closely associated patio groups. No evidence for communal storage, food processing, or other activities were revealed. 
An exception to the self-sufficiency of house­holds was that none appeared to produce pottery. Indeed, firing loci, caches of clay, wasters, and other manufacturing evidence were not found in fieldwork. Additionally, spindle whorls were made by the rather laborious process of modifying bro­ken wall sherds from large storage vessels, pro­viding evidence, albeit indirect, that ceramics were not made at the site. 
Ceramics recovered within all patio groups fell into the Nasca 3 and Nasca 4 phases (e.g., Proulx 1968), and radiocarbon dates from charcoal sam­ples span a relatively short period of time (Table 3). Although when two standard deviations are taken into consideration, the occupation of the site could encompass several centuries, all three radio­carbon dates overlap within the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fifth centuriesA. D., specif­ically A. D. 370-420, suggesting that this interval may have been the primary occupation of the site. Overall, the shallow deposits, the relatively restricted phases of the pottery, as well as the radio­carbon dates suggest a short occupation at Marcaya. 
Though fieldwork did not reveal evidence for its manufacture, pottery was the most ubiquitous artifact. The pottery included what was defined as utilitarian ware (wall thickness 6 mm or more) and fine ware (wall thickness less than 6 mm). This arbi­trary classification separated the vessel assemblage into two basic categories: painted polychrome pot­tery and plain utilitarian pottery. 
This classification encompassed all vessel types except for one. The exception was a type of glob­ular jar simply decorated with wide, wavy, maroon lines on a white or buff background with black out­line. Strong (1957:Figure 12) originally referred to this design as Cahuachi Broad Line Red, White, and Black, and others have followed (Silverman

1993). In published literature, this design is only present on a particular vessel form, referred to as Three-Handled Jars (shape TIT) (Kroeber and Col­lier 1998:Figures 90, 128, 155, and 187; Proulx 1970:64 and Plate 12E). I refer to these jars sim­ply as "painted jars" (Vaughn and Neff 2000), and the term refers specifically to these three-handled jars with the Cahuachi Broad Line Red, White, and Black design. Painted jars are an exception to the dichotomy between utilitarian ware and fine ware because they are painted (although sometimes crudely) but have very thick walls. In this paper, these painted jars are referred to as utilitarian wares because of their wall thickness. 
Both utilitarian and fine wares were found in all excavated contexts (Figures 8 and 9). When the MNI indicator is used4 the proportion of fine ware vessels at Marcaya amounts to 55 percent of the total vessel assemblage (Table 4). Compositional analysis of the pottery through neutron activation demonstrated that the composition of the utilitar­ian wares varied while the fine wares were com­positionally homogeneous, strongly suggesting that although they were not produced at the site, poly­chrome pottery was produced in a concentrated context (Vaughn and Neff 2000), one of the indi­cators of specialization (Costin 1991). 
Nasca Polychrome Consumption at Marcaya 
Table 5 lists all vessels by type, count, and per­centage of the total assemblage recovered at Mar­caya in excavations. Almost half ( 45 percent) of the vessel assemblage is composed of polychrome bowls (30 percent) and bulbous vases (15 percent). The next 32 percent of the assemblage consists of plain ollas (23 percent) and plain collared jars (9 percent), while the remaining 23 percent is com­posed of the other vessel types. With the exception of a few vessel shapes that seem related to status differences (see below), the proportions of vessel

types are relatively consistent across households. 
Additionally, the pottery at Marcaya was clas­sified into functional categories (e.g., Sinopoli 1991 : 84). Vessel types were divided into the three basic categories of cooking, serving, and storage, and an additional category of "other" when func­tion could not be determined. This functional clas­sification reveals that all serving vessels are polychrome fine wares, including bowls, dishes, and vases, while all vessels relating to storage and preparation of food are utilitarian wares, including undecorated jars, painted jars, and unpainted ollas (Table 5). With the exception of several very small plainware bottles (n 3), plainware vessel shapes 
= 
that would have functioned as serving vessels were not found at Marcaya. This fact is consistent with Silverman's (1993) previous excavations at Cahuachi, as she found that the only utilitarian ves­sels used for serving were plainware bowls, restricted to the earlier Nasca 1 occupation of the site (Silverman 1993:Figure 16.34). 

Thus, quite literally, crafts at Marca ya were used for consumption. Polychromes were used for serv­ing and consuming food and drink. Vessel shapes include bowls of varying types (flaring bowls, straight bowls, convex bowls, very deep bottom bowls, cup bowls, and dishes5), bulbous vases, and jars (collared jars, head jars; Figure 10). Despite the variety of vessel shapes, the majority of poly­chromes at Marca ya consisted of flaring bowls and bulbous vases, found with regularity in all house­holds. 
If patio groups were residential units (as deter­mined in excavations), we would expect functional categories of pottery to be distributed relatively equally across them. That is, each patio group should have yielded the necessary pottery to sus­tain a small household. Indeed, each patio group excavated had vessels for preparing food (atlas), storing food and drink (undecorated jars, painted jars), and for serving food and drink (bowls, dishes, vases, jars). The most significant find, however, was that all households had access to fine ware polychromes. Thus, the data from Marcaya confirm assessments made previously that polychromes were ubiquitous in Nasca domestic contexts and

were in fact used for everyday consumption in Nasca society. 
Status Differences in Polychrome Consumption at Marcaya 
Polychrome fine wares, however, should not be con­sidered a single undifferentiated class of artifacts. According to previous analyses of Nasca pottery, several vessel shapes have been classified as "pres­tigious" forms associated with high status. Proulx (1968: 13) suggests that the Nasca double spout and bridge bottle, the hallmark of the Nasca style, was the most prestigious vessel type. Additionally, analy­sis by Carmichael revealed only two polychrome vessel shapes reserved for mid-to high-status graves: paired and miniature vessels (Carmichael 1995:171). He also noted that particular vessel shapes such as the double spout and bridge bottle, the cup bowl, and collared jar (Carmichael 1988:313, 396) were primarily associated with mid­to high-status graves, though they were occasion­ally found in low-status graves as well. 
Double spout and bridge bottles, miniature ves­sels, and paired vessels were riot found at Marca ya. Apparently, none of these were part of the domes­tic vessel assemblage, and their absence suggests that they may have been reserved for burials. There were, however, notable differences in polychrome pottery consumption among households defined as high and low status (see Table 2). While poly­chrome pottery at Marcaya was consumed in high quantities at all patio groups, a greater quantity was consumed in the two excavated high-status house­holds: X and XII. There were also several vessel shapes found solely within these two high-status households. In particular, modeled headjars were found only in excavations here. At least four head­jars, and possible fragments of more, were found

Panpipes. Panpipes were rare and restricted to four patio groups (X, XI, XII, XIV ). The highest quantity of these artifacts was found in Patio Groups X and XII. Although present in Patio Group XI, panpipes were rare there, and limited excava­tions in Patio Group XIV yielded only one small fragment. The frequency of panpipes in Patio Groups X and XII correlates with the high quanti­

.ties and diversity of polychromes associated with those patio groups. Because of their use in cere­monial contexts (see Silverman 1993), presumed specialized manufacture (Dawson 1964 ), and restricted distribution, panpipes also seem to cor­relate with higher status at Marcaya, with high-sta­tus households having access to more of these goods. 
Status Differences at Marcaya. In sum, the evi­dence from surface analysis and excavations sug­gests that the households represented by Patio Groups X and XII were of higher status than other households. While other patio groups had high­quality architecture, some fineware, and panpipe remains, these two patio groups had all of the cri­teria used to evaluate status at Marcaya. They were two of the larger patio groups, they had internal architecture, and their houses were constructed of worked stone. Additionally, excavation revealed high quantities of polychromes, restricted vessel types such as head jars, and a higher quantity of pan­pipes than other excavated households. 

Discussion 

Excavations at Marcaya demonstrate that an entire class of finely crafted objects-polychrome pot­tery-was available to a wide range of people in Nasca society and consumed by individuals and households of both high and low status. Poly-

chromes, especially bowls and vases, were used for daily consumption in the household context. Although by virtue of their appearance and rela­tive fineness, they seem to be a prestige good-the kind archaeologists often assume were reserved for elites-Nasca polychromes were used ubiqui­tously. Even so, the data from Marcaya also sug­gest that Nasca polychromes should not be analyzed as a single homogeneous class of finely made objects. Indeed, certain vessel types were restricted to households of higher status, in partic­ular headjars, cup bowls, modeled vessels, and col­lared jars. What does the extent and differences in this consumption at Marcaya mean in terms of the role of crafts in Nasca society and in middle-range societies in general? 
Feasting, Household Ritual, and the Consump­tion of Polychromes 
In an attempt to understand the apparent distribu­tion of polychromes throughout the Nasca heart­land, Silverman and Proulx (2002:246) suggest that "(the) pottery was widely circulated ... for the pur­pose of widespread participation in Nasca ritual." Additionally, they suggest that panpipes at habita­tions suggest "home rituals and portage to other rit­ual sites" (Silverman and Proulx 2002:201). The principal rituals of Nasca most likely were enacted at Cahuachi, where important individuals spon­sored large feasts and group ceremonies (Silverman 1993; Silverman and Proulx 2002: 132; Strong 1957:3; Valdez 1994) that welcomed the annual harvest, or perhaps the renewed flooding of rivers each year to nourish the fields (see, for example, Carmichael 1998 :224; DeLeonardis 2000:364). Along the dry desert coast where water was such a critical resource, individuals who sponsored feasts and ceremonies tied to agricultural cycles would have gained significant status as mediators between the natural and supernatural worlds. In fact, these feasts were opportunities for their sponsors to dis­play and negotiate their status (Silverman and Proulx 2002:244), making them charged political events. People from the region made periodic pil­grimages to the site to take part in ceremonies that enabled frequent and repetitive status negotiation between those who sponsored the feasts and those who participated in them. 
Based on the data presented here, I suggest that the activities at Cahuachi were replicated locally within communities, albeit at a smaller scale. This is consistent with Silverman and Proulx's hypoth­esis that fine pottery "in Nasca domestic contexts could have acted ... to maintain the relationship between distant ritual and supracommunal sacred settings and the dynamic, localized social order" (Silverman and Proulx 2002:264). These rituals were performed in local villages, perhaps to con­tinue to ensure agricultural success, which must have been a constant concern in this dry environ­ment. Communal feasting areas and spaces were not present at Marcaya, suggesting that rituals were limited to the household rather than for the com­munity as a whole. 
Differences between household and communal ritual have been noted among traditional Andean groups. For example, among the Sonqo, Allen (1988:201) notes differences between communal festivals and household ritual: "In communal fes­tivals, it is not the household but the ayllu (com­munity) as a whole that commands ritual attention." These communal festivals for the entire ayllu often

took the form of processions and pilgrimages. In contrast, certain small-scale rituals such as the "despacho, " in which the earth and sacred places are nourished with offerings of coca, food, and alcohol, occurred within the house and were led by the head of the household (Allen 1988:153). Per­haps similar distinctions were made in Nasca, where large processions and pilgrimages to Cahuachi were followed by public feasts and com­munal celebrations, while smaller rituals were con­ducted within the household. Allen also illustrates that "power objects" in Sonqo called enqa and istrilla are extremely impor­-tant in understanding the ritual lives of modem 
'indigenous Andean groups (Allen 1988:201). These power objects were brought out on special ceremonial occasions from their holding places. They are said to be kawsaqkuna or "living ones" and "they are the source of the health and fertility of the livestock, the crops, and the family members themselves" (Allen 1988:59). Furthermore, they "store vitality and well-being by forging a con­nection between the household and the Sacred Places" in Sonqo (Allen 1988:201). Perhaps poly­chromes were "power objects" in the same sense thatAllen uses the term, as they connected the activ­ities taking place at sacred places such as Cahuachi directly back to the households of Nasca. 
Sacred Concerns in Mundane Settings ? If poly­chrome iconography was the principal means of disseminating Nasca ideology, the ubiquitous pres­ence of polychromes at a residential village strongly indicates that ceremonial concerns in Early Nasca societywere not limited to regional centers. In eval­uating Nasca iconography, Patrick Carmichael ( 1992b: 187) suggests that Nasca researchers have implicitly assumed a sacred vs. secular dichotomy in Nasca art whereby mythical beings represented the sacred realm, while agricultural products and naturally depicted human beings represented the mundane, or secular, realm. Carmichael asserts that this is essentially a Eurocentric view of Nasca iconography, and that no such dichotomy existed in the ancient Andean world. Instead, Nasca iconography should be analyzed contextually, and if a sacred/secular dichotomy is not assumed, the entire body of images can be seen as interrelated visually with no clear division between the sacred and secular realms of life. 
Similarly, I submit that there was no clear sep-

aration between these two spheres in prehispanic Nasca. Even in one of the most mundane of human acts-eating and drinking-no such division existed between the sacred and secular. Eating and drinking took place within the household using polychrome pottery, and the very act of consump­tion must have been a ritually charged event, whether it took place in a house at Marcaya or in a plaza at Cahuachi. The regular appearance of finely decorated serving vessels within households speaks to their use in everyday consumption. As polychromes were integrated into daily life, the ideologies initially played out at Cahuachi were reinforced in the household. 
Status Building in Nasca Communities 

While the religious symbols displayed on poly­chromes must have appealed to all members of society and created a demand for these crafts, the differential consumption of certain vessel types among households at Marcaya suggests that cer­tain individuals engaged in activities aimed at enhancing their own prestige. This is not surpris­ing as all consumers at residential sites engage in power relations (Goldstein 2000:336), with self­interested individuals and groups often attempting to gain control of relatively high value goods (Blan­ton 1995; Goldstein 2000; Helms 1993; LeCount 1999; Stein 1998). In fact, the very emergence of inequality is initiated and propelled by individuals (or groups) with disparate agendas and strategies to compete for eminence (see for example, Blan­ton et al. 1996; Brumfiel and Fox 1994). The arti­factual evidence from Marcaya indicates that the households of Patio Groups X and XII may have been making such efforts. 
Again, a traditional Andean group may illumi­nate the patterns apparent at Marcaya. In modem Sonqo, alcaldes (mayors) serve as the ritual leader of the ayllu (Allen 1988:117). The alcalde is responsible for heading communal work parties and initiates dances at important feasts (Allen 1988: 117). Allen indicates that his very presence "validates public functions in which the Runakuna (people) act as a collective body and are actualized as an ayllu" (Allen 1988: 117). The alcalde has no real coercive political power and instead his author­ity lies in his "capacity to serve as a focus around which the ayllu coheres" (Allen 1988: 117). Perhaps the high-status households at Marcaya served sim­ilar capacities in Nasca rituals and processions where they represented the community as a whole and acted as intermediaries between the commu­nity and activities at Cahuachi. 
Headjars, Fertility, and Status. At Marcaya, sev­eral vessel types with restricted consumption cor­relate with defined status differences. The most important of these are the modeled head jars, though other restricted vessel shapes included cup bowls, collared jars, modeled vessels, and very-deep bot­tomed bowls. While all were used for drinking and serving, why were these particular shapes highly valued? Analysis of the head jars in particular may provide clues to the importance of these vessel shapes. 
Recently, Lisa DeLeonardis (2000) has argued that whether in actual (i.e., disembodied, or "tro­phy" heads) or representational (i.e., iconography, or head jars) form, the head was the most important symbol of fertility and the "life-force essence" of Nasca (DeLeonardis 2000:381 ). Indeed, the corre­lation of heads to agricultural motifs is well known in analyses of Nasca iconography (see Blasco and Ramos 1980; Carmichael l 992b, 1994; Proulx 1989; Sawyer 1966; Silverman and Proulx 2002), and as previously stated, the correlation is often direct with the "Sprouting Head" motif as a clear example (Carmichael 1992b). 

While headjars at Marcaya appear to be repre­sentations of live individuals, their potency was probably no less than those "disembodied" heads representing dead individuals, especially because the distinction between life and death was blurred in the Andean world (see for example Allen 1988:63, as well as Carmichael 1994 for a Nasca example). If we consider head jars to be represen­tations of specific people (DeLeonardis 2000:381 ), and perhaps given the elaborate headdresses and facial markings, high-status individuals, the repre·· sentation of their heads in ceramic form would have captured the most important element of that per­sona. It is therefore not surprising to see that their physical representation, skillfully manifested in modeled headjars, became the most prestigious vessel at domestic sites. 
The use of headjars would have provided a direct link to an important individual. Although obviously we are in no position to determine who these indi­viduals were, we can speculate that they were important ancestors or perhaps important living

individuals. Since headjars were most likely ves­sels from which to drink, I suggest that they pro­vided a very direct link between Nasca religion incorporating fertility concepts, specific important individuals, and the very act of consumption itself. 
In her discussion of polychrome consumption in Terminal Classic Lowland Maya sites, Lisa Lecount (1999) suggests that individuals of high status who may have greater access to elite ideol­ogy can use materials that manifest this ideology as political currency to further individual and group political ambitions. In a similar vein, I suggest that the status differences at Marcaya were a result of the affiliations that high-status households had with activities at Cahuachi. In the case of Nasca, serv­ing as intermediaries between local communities and the ceremonial center would have been of great value for the self-interest of those who sought to enhance their own prestige. By being intermedi­aries, these individuals may have had direct access to the ceremonial and feasting activities at Cahuachi, and perhaps even the esoteric know ledge retained by the elites of Early Nasca. 
Concluding Remarks 
While it has been demonstrated that polychromes were vital to Nasca domestic life, it is difficult to fully understand their importance without exam­ining the initial production and subsequent distri­bution of ceramic crafts in Nasca society. To understand the broader implications of this study, we should seek to understand the entire craft econ­omy of Nasca. 
Because polychromes were not produced at Marcaya they must have been obtained elsewhere either through exchange or redistribution. The homogeneity of the polychrome pastes along with the variable composition of other wares indicates _that polychromes were produced in a restricted focus. This proposition has been further supported by additional compositional studies of polychrome paints from Early Nasca sites located in the SNR that suggested a very uniform black paint recipe (Vaughn et al. 2004 ). 
Given the weight of current evidence, I suggest that the most likely locus of Nasca polychrome production was Cahuachi and that a surplus of poly­chromes not only was produced there, but also was distributed to groups making pilgrimages to the site (see also Vaughn 2000; Vaughn and Neff 2000). 
The actual mechanism by which polychromes were distributed is not known, but one possibility is that they were distributed during the ceremonial feasts. This is consistent with ethnographic and archaeo­logical examples of feasting and the manner in which highly valued crafts can be distributed in middle-range societies. Feasts were politically charged events that enabled individuals and groups to enhance their own status, often through the gift­ing of important material items and the serving of large quantities of food and drink. 
In Nasca, a clear link existed between agricul­tural fertility and polychrome pottery, as this class of objects provided the principal vehicle for Nasca ideology. Ceremonial feasts that involved large amounts of polychrome pottery-and perhaps the distribution of this pottery-would have provided the sponsors of these feasts an opportunity to link themselves directly to agricultural fertility, the most important concern in Nasca ritual life, thus greatly enhancing their status. 
Wherever the locus of ceramic production and distribution in Nasca, whether it was limited to Cahuachi or included other production centers, the act of producing the sacred pottery must have been imbued with special significance. Certainly, the process of creating the pottery and the subsequent control of that production would have bestowed sig­nificant status to the individual or group of indi­viduals responsible. 

I have considered the consumption of highly valued crafts in middle-range societies by evaluat­ing the consumption of polychrome pottery in Early Nasca society. While much work is needed to fully understand the Nasca craft economy, and the con­clusions reached here must be tested against future studies at comparable sites within the region, I have attempted to explain the apparent contradiction between the restricted production yet widespread distribution and consumption of Nasca polychrome pottery. Clearly, polychrome production, circula­tion, and consumption in ancient Nasca was far more complicated than previously suspected, and the research presented here is but one of a growing number of examples indicating that the incorpora­tion of crafts into the economies of middle-range societies was multifaceted and complex.

Notes 
1. Phase 1 of the Nasca sequence is culturally part of the earlier Ocucaje sequence (see Cook 1999; Silverman and Proulx 2002:25, 38). 
2. 
Reindel and Isla (1998, 2001) suggest that Los Molinos, a Nasca 3 civic-ceremonial center, is a regional cen­ter characteristic of state-level societies. 

3. 
Collomas have been recorded previously at other sites located in the south coast. Kroeber (1944: 137), for example, reported what he thought were tombs: subsurface, rock-lined pits at Huaca Santa Rosa. Others (Massey 1986:315; Wallace 1971) have suggested that, although these features may have been reutilized as tombs by later populations, their contents and placement indicate instead that they were storage pits. While some collomas found at Marcaya were empty or filled with sterile sand, many contained domestic garbage and the remains of comestibles. It was therefore concluded that these were used for domestic storage. 

4. 
The MNI records the minimum number of vessels pre­sent in an assemblage by using non-conjoining rim sherds as a proxy measure for entire vessels (see Clark and Blake 1994:28; Silverman 1993; Vaughn 2000). 

5. 
The Nasca vessel repertoire outlined by Proulx (1968: 13) defines dishes as "interior decorated vessels of varying depth." The dishes of Nasca 3 and 4 tend to be as deep as bowls.
